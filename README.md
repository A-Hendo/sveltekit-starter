# SupaSvelte

SupaSvelte is a SvelteKit boilerplate, designed to help you supercharge your SaaS startup to ship in days, not weeks.

## Requirements
    - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)


## Developing

Once you've created a new repo from this template and installed dependencies with `yarn install`, start a development server:

```zsh
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```zsh
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment, note [adapter-auto](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/adapter-auto) is installed which should automatically choose the correct SvelteKit adapter.
